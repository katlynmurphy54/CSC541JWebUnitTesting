# CSC 541/741 - Software Testing - Spring 2021 

## JWebUnitTesting - Benjamin Smith and Katlyn Murphy

This is the source code for our submission of the CSC 541 group project in Spring 2021 @ EKU.

Purpose: This assignment is to study and practice JWebUnit: 
1. Go to the following web sites to study JWebUnit: https://jwebunit.github.io/jwebunit/
2.	Download the software and practice it with a web site of your choice: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jwebunit/files/
3.	Design your test cases to test the selected web site, and take snapshots of the testing results.
4.	Write a report about your study and opinions of the tool.  Include your testing results in the report. 
5.	Submit your report to EKU Blackboard.
6.	Prepare a 10-minutes video presentation about your stud and testing results.  Upload the video to FlipGrid. The video will be a part of the assignment, and will be graded together with the report.

There is a java file attached of our test cases that we tested in Eclipse. There is also a simply report attached that includes screenshots of our test case results and brief descriptions of them along with a follow up of our opinions on JWebUnit.
